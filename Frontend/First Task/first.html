<h1>EREN YEAGER</h1>
<p align="black" style="font-style: italic; color: grey; border: 5;">Eren is best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which are attributes of his strong determination to protect mankind and eventually escape the Walls.
    
It's easy to assume that Eren Yeager just becomes evil in Attack On Titan, and although he undeniably fell from grace, he's more of a tragic anti-hero than anything else - even an actual hero, at least, in comparison to a villain.</p>
